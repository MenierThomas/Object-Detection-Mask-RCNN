# Object-Detection-Mask-RCNN

## Instructions : 
- Build a dataset of at least 150 images and label them (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/)
- Prepare an environment for MRCNN libraries
- download the COCO model
- retrain the head layers

Your report, preferably in a github page, will contain:
- the log file of the training with the last line showing the different losses
- extracts of your dataset for training / validation as well as a few "production" or test images
- a matrix of confusion
- a graph representing the train and validation losses
- the hyperparameters you used (activation, lr, optimizer, epochs),  the more the hyperparameters you tried, the higher the grade
- a smart human-generated comment linked to your results
